        <h2>About me</h2>
        <img id="my-image" src="images/sudip.jpg" alt="sudip's image">
        <p>I am Sudip Shrestha. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate diploma in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I just turned 18 this month and I do most of the things by myself as I came from Nepal and I don't have anyone to rely on. I have two jobs here in Canada and after every shift I got so tired that i curse my decision of coming here in Canada. Then, I come to realise that it's better to live with responsibility than living all privileged. I came here to learn about different things and it's going pretty well.</p>

        <p>
            I am living one and a half hour far from college so, it's a lil bit pain in the ... to come to college early in the morning. I love playing computer games like COD, DOTA2, Counter Strike and also the outdoor games like football, basketball, volleyball and many more. I used to be in a football club back in 10<sup>th</sup> grade. And here I am just living my life by sacrificing my sleep to go to work. I just need money man! that's why i do my shifts. I do part time bug bounty hunting. I tried doing day trading but didn't understand sh!t. I mean it's very hard to understand and analyse the chart hahah. I am currently working on my mobile application which will be completely based on java as I already have a bit experiece on back end development. I am about to use xml in android studio for front end for my app. I think... that's it for now....
